Octal (base-8) wall clock time

Each day consists of two halfs of 8 hours each, each hour is divided in 64 minutes, each minute is divided in 64 seconds. The figure of 64 is 8 times 8, so all minutes and seconds get evenly divided in groups of 8 over the hours. Thsi means that 1 hour on the octal clock equals 1.5 hours on the regular clock.

Instead of the number 1 through 8, which might easily be confused with the first 8 digits of the usual clock numbers 1 through 12, you could also use 8 characters derived from the ligatures in the Shavian character set as octal digits, as follows:
Octal digit | Shavian digit
------------ | -------------
1 | 𐑹
2 | 𐑼
3 | 𐑸
4 | 𐑾
5 | 𐑺
6 | 𐑽
7 | 𐑻
8 | 𐑿
